# QUICK AND DIRTY MOD GUIDE

With the 1.1.0 update, I added a bit of mod support backend.

It's POLYMOD, which is made by Lars Doucet: https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod

But, I made my own fork which is meant to be more compatible: https://github.com/Joalor64GH/polymod-joalor64

You may have noticed that there's a new folder in the zip. MODS. Within it you will a see folder called Template.

Now you may be wondering, what do I put in the folder? Well later down it'll get a bit more complicated, especially as I'll make the IN-GAME mod loader nicer.
